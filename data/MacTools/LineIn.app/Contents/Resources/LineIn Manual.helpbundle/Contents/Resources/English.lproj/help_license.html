<p><span class="heading">Distribution</span>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless explicitly stated in writing, Rogue Amoeba Software does not grant permission to distribute LineIn ("The Software") for profit in any form, including but not limited to, electronic information service distribution, bulletin board distribution, and magnetic or optical medium distribution. Non-profit distribution of The Software is acceptable provided that The Software is not modified in any way, and the complete works of The Software are included in the distribution package. If The Software is to be included in a distribution package, Rogue Amoeba requests one complimentary copy of said package, sent to the following address: 

<div align="left">
<br>Rogue Amoeba Software 
<br>Marketing Department 
<br>29 Scottsdale Ct. #1
<br>Cranbury, NJ 08512 
</div>
<br>
<strong>What that said:</strong> Don't sell this software. If you want to distribute it, awesome! Just make sure it's unmodified from the download from our site. If you create a distribution package, it'd be cool if you sent a copy to the address above, but you don't have to.

<p><span class="heading">Disclaimer</span>
<br>LineIn ("The Software") is provided as is. Rogue Amoeba Software ("The Author") is not responsible for any damage to the user's computer system or data and in no event will The Author, its officers, directors, employees or agents be responsible to the user for any consequential, incidental, or indirect damages (including damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, lost of business information, and the like) arising out of the use or inability to use the The Software, even if The Author has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitations may not apply to you. Further, the consumer agrees that using this software in any way illegal, or even for the purposes of assessing its viability for illegal usage, is prohibited.

<br><br><strong>What that said:</strong> Be safe when you use the software. Be aware that it's simply a tool designed to make your life better. Don't use it to do illegal or evil things. If you do, be ready to take responsibility for your own actions.
