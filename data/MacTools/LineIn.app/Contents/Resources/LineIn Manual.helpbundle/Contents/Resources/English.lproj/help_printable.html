<p><b>New in 2.0.3</b> 
<br>+ Bug fixes and improvements for Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)

<p><b>Welcome!</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LineIn is a simple application for OS X, designed to enable the soft playthru of audio from input devices. In simpler terms, you can use LineIn to hear sound coming in through a microphone or any other device plugged in to your Sound In port, just as was once available with OS 9's "Play input through output device" option. It can be used with Audio Hijack to record audio from external devices.

<div class="centeredheading">How To Use LineIn</div>

<p align="center"><img src="../lineinmain.jpg" border="1" alt=""></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When LineIn loads, you'll see the main window shown above. This window allows you to select the Input device from which to pull audio and the Output device to/through which it will be played. For adjusting advanced settings such as device channels, click the Advanced button. Most of the settings found here should generally be left in their default states.

<p><b>Passing Audio Through</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pass audio through an output device, you first need to set an Input device from which to pull audio. Then the Output device must be set - this is the device through which the audio will play. Finally, click the Pass Thru button, and any audio played through the Input will run through the system and be heard via the Output. That's it!



<div class="centeredheading">LineIn Interfaces</div>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section of the Help gives details on what each piece of LineIn does. Click on one of the sub-sections to the left to jump to the specified window.

<br><br><b>Control Windows</b> - The basic control windows of LineIn contain all its key settings.

<br><br><b>Other Windows</b> - Information on the other minor windows in LineIn is found here.

<br><br><b>Menu Reference</b> - This section explains what each and every menu item does in obsessive, boring detail.
