TODO
----
-palette/color concept (greyscale, rgb, hsv...), currently we're mixing b/w, rgb and hsv, plus there is a tint effect
-rewrite output selection/configuration, 
-more generators/effects/mixer...
-Move message handling out to effective classes
-log to a file
-more layouts
-more threads! the output gets calculated on the fly, this means wait until the visuals are generated. if they would run in seperate thread, that would be faster...
-make nr. of available visuals configurable (at least nr. of outputs). 
-Rainbowduino firmware: update initial image in firmware
-Rainbowduino firmware: add autonomous firmware mode, run simple animation if no computer is connected
