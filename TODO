TODO PixelController
--------------------
-palette/color concept (greyscale, rgb, hsv...), currently we're mixing b/w, rgb and hsv, plus there is a tint effect
-rewrite output selection/configuration, 
-more effects/mixer...
-move message handling out to effective classes (MessageProcessor.java, still unsure if this is a good idea..)
-Log output to a file instead the command line
-more layouts (what kind of layouts?)
-WIP create osc tabled gui for Control (OSC + MIDI) (http://charlie-roberts.com/Control)
-particle generator (rain,snow,fireworks...) remember: rip from cocos2d particle system


TODO PixelInvaders
------------------
-PixelInvaders firmware: update initial image in firmware
-PixelInvaders firmware: add autonomous firmware mode, run simple animation if no computer is connected


Done in v1.0.3
--------------
-add notification if random mode is selected or not
-more threads! the output gets calculated on the fly, this means wait until the visuals are generated. 
 if they would run in seperate thread, that would be faster...
-decoupling visual generation from output update, should increase performance
