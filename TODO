TODO
----
-palette/color concept (greyscale, rgb, hsv...), currently we're mixing b/w, rgb and hsv, plus there is a tint effect
-rewrite output selection/configuration, 
-add option for a zoomed screen (effect?)
-more generators/effects/mixer...
-update initial image in firmware
-Move message handling and randomizer handling out to effective classes
-log to a file
-more layouts
-color depth of MatrixEmulator be dependend on the selected output device (currently hardcoded)
-more threads! the output gets calculated on the fly, this means wait until the visuals are generated. if they would run in seperate thread, that would be faster...
