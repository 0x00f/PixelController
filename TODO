TODO PixelController
--------------------
-WIP: palette/color concept (greyscale, rgb, hsv...), currently we're mixing b/w, rgb and hsv, plus there is a tint effect
-particle generator (rain,snow,fireworks...) remember: maybe rip from cocos2d particle system, should replace fire and metaballs
-rewrite output selection/configuration, 
-more effects/mixer...
-move message handling out to effective classes (MessageProcessor.java, still unsure if this is a good idea..)
-more layouts (what kind of layouts?)
-do not freeze application if output fails (disconnect controller)
-artnet output: support multiple output devices / multiple universe
-MatrixData: make internal buffersize configurable (currently deviceSize*8)
-Unit Testing is suboptimal, using the config.properties 
-start PureData in the start script, for example /Applications/Pd-extended.app/Contents/Resources/bin/pd -stderr -nomidi -noaudio -open mtxrev-main.pd -send "preset-file ../presets/main.coll;" & 

Changelog v1.2 to v1.3
------------------------
-Support more output formate (not only RGB and RBG), thanks to noxx6
-configuration fixes

Changelog v1.1 to v1.2
------------------------
-PixelInvaders Firmware, fixed strip.doSwapBuffersAsap(0)
-Support AdaVision


Changelog v1.0.3 to v1.1
------------------------
-add notification if random mode is selected or not
-more threads! the output gets calculated on the fly, this means wait until the visuals are generated. 
 if they would run in seperate thread, that would be faster...
-decoupling visual generation from output update, should increase performance
-New Generators: ColorScroll, ColorFade and ScreenCapture. Removed Simple Colors
-PixelInvaders firmware: update initial image in firmware
-PixelInvaders firmware: add autonomous firmware mode, run simple animation if no computer is connected
-ScreenCapture: make capturing area visible to user
-create osc tabled gui for Control (OSC + MIDI) (http://charlie-roberts.com/Control)
-manual mapping to support fancy led mapping (OnePanelResolutionAwareOutput class). define a configuration property like 
 output.mapping=1,2,5,6,3,4,7,8 ...
-Log output to a file instead the command line
-artnet output: make first universe id configurable
-possible to start pixelcontroller with a preset
