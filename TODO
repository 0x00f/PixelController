-add option for a zoomed screen
-more generators/effects/mixer...
-update initial image in firmware
-Move message handling and randomizer handling out to effective classes
-log to a file
-more layouts
-color depth of MatrixEmulator be dependend on the selected output device (currently hardcoded)
-more threads! the output gets calculated on the fly, this means wait until the visuals are generated. if they would run in seperate thread, that would be faster...
-update generators only if they are visiable
