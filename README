PixelController - a matrix control project by Michael Vogt <michu at neophob.com>, (c) 2010-2011
I want to create an easy to use matrix controller software which creates stunning visuals!

HOWTO USE PIXELCONTROLLER
-------------------------
Prerequisite:
-Java Runtime, v1.6+
-PureData (http://puredata.info/), download the extended Version

Run PixelController.cmd on Windows and PixelController.sh on OSX/Linux to start the application.
Make sure your led matrix connected to you computer before the application is started and you
configured your hardware ind the config.properties file.

Here is a very primitve diagram, how everything is connected:
[PURE DATA FRONTEND]---<TCP>---[PIXELCONTROLLER]---<SERIAL>---[ARDUINO OR TEENSY]---[LED MODULES]


DEMO
----
Check out http://vimeo.com/27453711 and http://vimeo.com/32580251 to see PixelController in action 
on two PixelInvaders panels. 


SUPPORTED HARDWARE
------------------
PixelController supports different (LED) matrix hardware devices:
-PixelInvaders 3d Panels (see Readme.PixelInvaders)
-Seeedstudios Rainbowduino (see Readme.rainbowduino), hine the new v3 models are currently NOT supported!
-ArtNet Devices, multiple universe are supported,510 Channels (170 RGB Pixels) per universe
-MiniDmx Devices (like the SEDU board of http://www.led-studien.de)


HOWTO BUILD PIXELCONTROLLER
---------------------------
Prerequisite:
-Maven v2.x (if you use maven 3, make sure to read http://neophob.com/2011/11/maven-3-is-evil/ first!)
-JDK 1.6+

Then run 
# mvn initialize
to install the needed packages in your local repo and

# mvn clean package
to build PixelController, the distribution directory is "target/assembly/PixelController-VERISON/".


IT DOES NOT WORK!
-----------------
Try to understand WHAT not works, which component, it's the frontend? PixelController itself? or no output?

Here are some common errors:
-Did you forgot to edit the configuration file "config.properties", take a look!
-Did you flash the correct firmware to you Arduino/Teensy? (https://github.com/neophob/PixelController/tree/master/data/ArduinoFw/lpd6803/neoLedLPD6803)
-A User reported that the pixelinvader firmware did not work on a new Arduino UNO r3 board. I think the reason
 for this is the big serial latency. However using a Arduno UNO r1 worked flawlessly.
